Hi Paul,
 
Just to let you know the sizes of the actual box we will be using as measured today (all measurements in mm and width x height). See attached photos.
 
1.      There are eight rows of windows on each side of the 3 sides (including the door) which consist of the two small panes and the one large pane in between them, so 24 large panes in all.
 
The large pane is 367x177mm measuring to the edge of the frame on the outside but on the inside measuring to the inside of the frame it is 390x200mm.  However the inside measurement doesn’t allow for any glass (there is none there just now) so there will probably be around 5mm leaway all around on the inside measurements which would bring the size to 380x190mm, near enough to what was in the brief.
 
Outside measurements to the frame for more than one row of windows (ie from the inside of the top of the top window frame to the bottom of the bottom window frame) are as follows for if you want to put a larger picture across a number of windows:
One        367x177mm (as above)
Two       367x380mm
Three     367x587mm
Four       367x790mm
Five        367x996mm
Six          367x1200mm
Seven    367x1405mm
Eight      367x1612mm
 
2.      The four top panes with the word “telephone” are 620x90mm on the outside, so with a 5mm margin this comes to 630x100mm which is different from in the brief!
 
3.      The panel on the inside is 744x1274mm, so actually larger than A0 but can be cut to any size depending on what Rory needs.
(A2 is 420 x 594 mm; A1 is 594 x 841 mm; A0 is 841 x 1189 mm)
 
4.      The cost we have for production and installing all of the above is £662 which includes the vat, so £551.60+vat.
 
 
Hope this helps,
 
Cheers
 
Marian
